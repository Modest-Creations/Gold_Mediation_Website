        <div><h1><ul>Conduct of Mediation</ul></h1></div>
        <div><p>Unless otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by the Court, the
            mediation shall be conducted according to all applicable mediation Florida Statutes and Rules.
            This specifically includes all protections of privilege, confidentiality and immunity. I shall serve
            as an independent mediator, providing neither legal representation nor legal advice to any
            participant in the mediation. </p></div>
        
        <div><h1><ul>Mediation Fee</ul></h1></div>
        <div><p>The mediation fee is calculated using my billing rate, the time reserved and premediation or post mediation time I spend in this matter. There is a two hour minimum charge for
            all mediations. There is NO administrative charge. There is NO charge for travel time. </p></div>
        
        <div><h1><ul>Allocation of Fees & Payment</ul></h1></div>
        <div><p>Unless otherwise agreed, the mediation fees and costs shall be
            divided equally among the parties participating in the mediation. Payment is due upon your
            receipt of my bill. While my bill may be subject to reimbursement from your client to you, or
            even forwarded to your client for direct payment, please understand that my relationship is with
            you and that I will ultimately look to you to secure payment. </p></div>
        
        <div><h1><ul>Hourly Billing Rate</ul></h1></div>
        <div><p> The mediation fee that is charged is an hourly amount. I bill at a very
            competitive rate of $325.00 per hour.</p></div>
        
        <div><h1><ul>Mediation Summaries</ul></h1></div>
        <div><p>I will review any documents and materials you may regard as relevant. I
            request that you provide my office with copies of such materials together with a case summary at
            least five (5) days prior to the mediation. </p></div>
        
        <div><h1><ul>Cancellations</ul></h1></div>
        <div><p> Cancellations place an undue burden upon the mediator. Therefore, I must receive
            at least a 3 day notice in order to avoid a 2-hour cancellation charge. </p></div>
